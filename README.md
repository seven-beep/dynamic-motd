# Dynamic motd

The aim of this project is to give some informations when you log into a server through SSH.

Example:

```

   ___  ___ _ ____   _____ _ __
  / __|/ _ \ '__\ \ / / _ \ '__|
  \__ \  __/ |   \ V /  __/ |
  |___/\___|_|    \_/ \___|_|

**Warning** This is Debian and Debian-related distributions only.

## Installation

### Debian package

Go to <https://framagit.org/luc/dynamic-motd/-/releases/permalink/latest>, download the Debian package and its signature file.

Check the signature of the Debian package and install the package:
```bash
minisign -Vm dynamic-motd_*.deb -P RWRzxrp04vb4Db3sle7Az6kSeCipT1ixRjRZPXdUUQuuwgi9UW81E+dx &&
sudo apt install ./dynamic-motd_*.deb
```

### Manual installation

You need to install some packages:

```
apt-get install figlet lsb-release bc python3-utmp
```

Optionally, you can install `needrestart` which is used to show a message if your server need a reboot (main reason (and the only one I know): you have upgraded your kernel).
If you don't install `needrestart`, it will work, but you won't be warned about the need for a reboot.
`needrestart` warns you about services that need to be restarted too (but is slower than `checkrestart` for that, see below).

You can optionally install `debian-goodies` which provides `checkrestart`, which will be used to warn you about services that need to be restarted. Relying on `needrestart` for that is slow (Â±7 seconds) while `checkrestart` do it faster (less than one second).

Check out the repo (to a folder of your choice)
```
git clone https://framagit.org/luc/dynamic-motd.git
cd dynamic-motd/
```

Then, as `root`:
```
cp -r update-motd.d/ /etc
rm /etc/motd
ln -s /var/run/motd /etc/motd
```

## Disabling for some users

Just create a `/etc/update-motd.d/hushlogin` file containing the names of the users, like:

```
alice
bob
```

## Salt

You will find a working salt formula in `init.sls`.

```
cd /srv/salt
git clone https://framagit.org/luc/dynamic-motd.git motd
salt your_server state.sls motd
```
